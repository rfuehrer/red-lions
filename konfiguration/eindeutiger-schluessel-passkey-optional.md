# Unique key / Passkey \(optional\)

You can optionally add to your name/pseudonym under

[https://apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey](https://apps.foldingathome.org/getpasskey)

to generate an individual key \(passkey\). With this key, the points can always be clearly assigned to your account later. You will also receive bonus points if you create a passkey and enter it in the client.

It will be sent to your specified email address within a few minutes.

{% hint style="info" %}
With Folding@Home, participants can give themselves any name they want. If several users use identical names, they cannot be distinguished. The passkey ensures that the points are only awarded to your account. It is therefore a help to distinguish between the accounts.
