# Quick guide for initial setup of the Folding@Home client

At this point we would like to give you a guide to set up the Folding@Home clients for the benefit of COVID-19 research to participate in a common, private commitment. You can read the steps to set up the client by using the navigation on the left side of the screen. 

Basically it is quite simple: 

1. Download the client 
2. Installation of the client 
3. Configuration of the client

Afterwards the program works automatically in the background at every system start and supports the Folding@Home project and our team.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the meantime, we also offer a backend component to determine the team ranking. This enables us to determine and track every change in a ranking. This function can be used flexibly as a Python in a docker and can be adapted to any team. You can find more information in the [Backend](https://github.com/generaliinformatik/fah-red-lions/tree/master/backend) folder.
{% endhint %}

In that spirit:

Happy contributing!
