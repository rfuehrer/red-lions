# Purpose

With the support of "Folding@Home" we can all participate in the digital search for a cure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus \("Corona crisis"\).

By participating in this digital initiative, we send a positive signal to all colleagues, friends, acquaintances and partners in the home office to join in. Everyone can volunteer the computing power of their private PC to join our F@H team "The Red Insurance Lions" \("Red Lions"\).

We see the search for a cure in all of our responsibilities to protect our family, friends, acquaintances, colleagues and customers in the long term from illness but also from the effects of the virus.
