# Our Team

The team consists of various colleagues from different locations. 

As a team means that the calculated points are awarded to the team and the team is compared by the achieved total points in the international ranking of all teams. It is therefore a playful approach for a good purpose. The more powerful the systems are and the more participants a team has, the faster further points are calculated. The team thereby achieves a better position in the ranking. 

The idea was initiated by 

* Stephan Steinkühler \(GDIS VG\)
* René Führer \(GDIS KB\) and 
* Michael Motter \(GSS\) 

Other colleagues have joined our team after the release. Some of these colleagues have also participated in other teams on Folding@Home, but with "Red Insurance Lions" they have now found a team with whom they can identify \(perhaps even better\).
