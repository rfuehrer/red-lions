# Installation of the client

Depending on the existing operating system, the client must be installed like any application under this operating system. During installation, a background process is installed that performs the calculation according to user settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
Running as a background process ensures that the client is executed each time the system starts and can perform its calculations if the system has the capacity to do so.
{% endhint %}

Start the downloaded file and confirm the installation routine dialogs. For Windows there is a detailed \(English\) manual:

After installation, the client is automatically executed in the background and a first configuration dialog is displayed. A first overview is opened in your browser. This overview can also be displayed later by calling the page
