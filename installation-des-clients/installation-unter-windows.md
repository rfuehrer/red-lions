# Installation on Windows

This section describes the custom installation of the F@H-Client on Windows XP and later. It assumes an initial installation, and unless otherwise specified, the default setting for each option is the recommended setting.

{% hint style="info" %}
To install a V7 F@H client to run as a service \(an option later in setup\), the Windows XP user account under which the installer runs must have administrative rights.
{% endhint %}

In Windows Vista and newer versions, the installation program must be opened with the Run as Administrator option. To do this, right-click the installer icon, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted to enter or confirm an administrator password, enter or confirm the password.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since administrator rights are required, installation on company systems will often not be possible. The software is **not approved** for use on company-owned hardware, so we ask you to use the software only on private systems!
{% endhint %}

Double-click the downloaded installer to start the software installation. A security warning may be displayed at startup:

The screen for the location of the user data files is displayed. 

An alternate data directory folder can be entered for the configuration and location of the data files. However, this is the recommended default. Click Next.

![Wie m&#xF6;chten Sie den Client starten?](../.gitbook/assets/wininst08.png)

The options for starting the software are displayed. These are very important to determine how the F@H client will be started in the future. They also select whether and how the F@H client on this computer will be controlled and monitored by FAHControl.

The automatic startup options shown in the figure correspond to the default settings used during the Express installation and are the recommended settings. Or select custom startup options below. The first option sets the F@H client to start at Windows logon. The second option sets the F@H client to run as a service and be visible only in the FAHControl interface. The third option is used to start the F@H client manually using a shortcut. The last option \(checkbox\) activates the screen saver mode of Folding@Home.

Click Install to continue. Please wait until Folding@Home has completed the installation.

The installation of the client is almost complete:

Note: Do not uncheck the checkbox to start Folding@Home so that the software starts automatically with Windows. If the box is unchecked, F@H client must be started manually each time.

You may see a Windows Firewall or other security software command prompt.

When prompted, select "Unlock" or "Allow access for software" to connect to the Internet.

The client will restart and display the configuration page - the installation is complete.
