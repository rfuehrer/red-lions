At this point we would like to give you a guide to set up the Folding@Home clients for the benefit of COVID-19 research to participate in a common, private commitment. You can read the steps to set up the client by using the navigation on the left side of the screen. 

Basically it is quite simple: 

1. [Download the client ](download-des-clients.md)
2. [Installation of the client ](installation-des-clients/)
3. [Configuration of the client](konfiguration/); the following settings should be specified for our team:

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Project | COVID-19 |
| Team name | The Red Insurance Lions - Worldwide |
| Team number | 263581 |

Afterwards the program works automatically in the background at every system start and supports the Folding@Home project and our team.

{% hint style="info" %}
We offer a backend component to determine the team ranking as open source software via our [Github repository](https://github.com/generaliinformatik/fah-red-lions). With the help of this software every change of a team ranking can be determined and tracked. 

This function can be used flexibly as Python in a docker and can be adapted to any team. You can find more information in our [Github repository](https://github.com/generaliinformatik/fah-red-lions).
{% endhint %}

In that spirit:

Happy contributing!
