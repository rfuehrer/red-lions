# Project selection

After entering the name, the team number and the passkey you will get to the overview after selecting the "Save" button.

In this overview you have to make one more important setting: the project you want to support.

You can also support another project at any time, as points are awarded to the Red Insurance Lions Worldwide team after each successful calculation. But we ask you to calculate for the project COVID-19.

The following selection must be made in the list:

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| I support research fighting | COVID-19 |

With the selection all future calculations for this project will be made.

If you also want the calculation to be a little faster and you are not dependent on the performance of your system, you can use the slider

| **Field** | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| POWER | Full |

to allocate more system resources to the calculation. Of course, you can always adjust this to your system performance and your requirements.

If you want the client to work only when the system is idle, please select the option "Only when idle".

This would complete the basic setting and you support the Folding@Home project in the Generali team. You can see our common success on the page
